defmodule LocalCents.Application do
  @moduledoc """
  The OTP application entry point — it builds and starts the supervision tree.

  LocalCents runs as a single Phoenix instance that a [Tauri](https://tauri.app)
  native shell spawns and drives (see the `README` and the project's Tauri notes
  for the bigger picture). This module is where that process tree is assembled.

  ## Supervised children

  Started under a `:one_for_one` supervisor, in order:

    * `LocalCentsWeb.Telemetry` — metrics and instrumentation.
    * `DNSCluster` — inert here. It ships in the `phx.new` scaffold for
      multi-instance node clustering, but LocalCents is a single-instance desktop
      app, so `DNS_CLUSTER_QUERY` is never set and it starts as a no-op.
    * `Phoenix.PubSub` — in-app process messaging.
    * `ElixirKit.PubSub` — the TCP bridge to the Rust/Tauri side. This is the one
      IPC channel between Elixir and native code.
    * `LocalCentsWeb.Endpoint` — the Phoenix HTTP endpoint.
    * A one-off `Task` that sends the `"ready"` handshake (see below).

  ## Tauri vs. standalone startup

  Startup branches on the `ELIXIRKIT_PUBSUB` environment variable:

    * **Launched by Tauri** — the native shell sets `ELIXIRKIT_PUBSUB` to the
      address it is listening on. `ElixirKit.PubSub` connects to it, and once the
      tree is up the startup `Task` broadcasts `"ready"` on the `"messages"`
      channel so Tauri knows it can open the WebView window.
    * **Standalone (`mix phx.server`, tests)** — the variable is unset, so
      `ElixirKit.PubSub` starts with `connect: :ignore` (a no-op) and no `"ready"`
      message is sent. This lets us develop and test the Phoenix side in complete
      isolation from the native shell.

  ## Boundary

  This module is promoted to a top-level `Boundary` so it can depend on the other
  top-level boundaries it wires into the supervision tree — the web layer
  (`LocalCentsWeb`) and the tracking context (`LocalCents.Tracking`) — without
  those layers having to depend on each other. See
  [Module Boundaries](module-boundaries.html).
